# Pymaceuticals-Challenge
What good is data without a good plot to tell the story?

In this challenge, I am a senior data analyst at a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. I have been tasks with creating the technical report of the clinical animal study involving mice. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

In this top-level summary of the study results, I have:
Prepared the data.
Generated summary statistics.
Created bar charts and pie charts.
Calculated quartiles, found outliers, and created a box plot.
Created a line plot and a scatter plot.
Calculated correlation and regression.
Written an analysis.
